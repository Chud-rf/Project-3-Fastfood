# Project-3-Fastfood Topic: Nutritional Content of Fast Food

## An overview of the project and its purpose
Our project provides the nutritional value of food sold at eight major chain fast food restaurants located in Minnesota, specifically at locations within the Twin Cities.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul This will allow users to analyze/compare several nutritional content:
* calories
* protein
* sodium
* carbohydrates
* fat
* sugar
* cholesterol
* fiber 

We have created visualizations that display the nutritional content of specific foods, compare food items, and compare the restaurants themselves. We also created an interactive quiz to help visitors guess the nutritional value of some of America's favorite fast foods.
