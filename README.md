# Project-3-Fastfood Topic: Nutritional Content of Fast Food

## An overview of the project and its purpose
Our project provides the nutritional value of food sold at eight major chain fast food restaurants located in Minnesota, specifically at locations within the Twin Cities.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul This will allow users to analyze/compare several nutritional content:
* calories
* protein
* sodium
* carbohydrates
* fat
* sugar
* cholesterol
* fiber 

We have created visualizations to display the nutritional content of specific foods and allow users to compare food items. We also created an interactive quiz to help visitors make informed choices when ordering some of America's favorite fast foods.

## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
Ethical considerations made for this project: we are assuming fast food is unhealthy. We chose to not utilize web scraping for pricing data since fast food companies as well as websites with priciing data specifically stated we could not scrape data. The source of the dataset is Kaggle.com and the Fastfood Nutrition dataset references this [license:](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and the Top 50 Fast-Food Chains in the USA dataset license is created from [QSR Magazine](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/). 

Most federal laws and regulations surrounding privacy and data regulations are aimed at protecting individual consumers. Our data is PygWalker
